Running `solve.py` on `dotdash.pcapng` pcap will return:
`-.-. - ..-. -.--. -.. --- - -....- -.. .- ... .... -....- ..-. - .-- -.--.-`

If you put that in https://morsecode.world/international/translator.html

you will get: `CTF(DOT-DASH-FTW)` 

Keep in mind `{}` don't exist so we use `()`

** To a defender it should be obvious what the covert channel is. However, they will not know what comination of `DF` and `EVIL` bits make up a `.` or `-` or ` `. So it is reccomended that there is a hint like name the file dotdash, talk about RFC 3514, and ensure they are aware of the flag format `CTF(ALL CAPS FLAG)` **
